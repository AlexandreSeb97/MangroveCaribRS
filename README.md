# MangroveCaribRS
Remote Sensing Health Analysis of Mangrove Forests in the Caribbean. 
This analysis makes use of an HistGradientClassifier and NDWI, NDVI indices for land classification to  track the canopy cover of mangroves in the region over the past decade (2010-2022). 
Metrics such as NDVI, UVVR, and Gross Cover Change are used to evaluate the evolution of mangrove health at three major Caribbean Sites: 
* Baie de Grand-Pierre, Artibonite, Haiti
* Baie de Caracol, Nord-Est, Haiti
* Caroni Swamp, Trinidad, Trinidad-and-Tobago
