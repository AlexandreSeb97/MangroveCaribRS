\abstract{The Grand-Pierre Bay, south of Gonaives, Haiti hosts the largest mangrove coverage of the country. It is also unique in the Caribbean region because it is the largest river-fed mangrove forest in the Caribbean islands. As such, it is host to extensive biodiversity and is an important socio-economic resource for the Artibonite region in Haiti. However, it has been a victim of anthropogenic pressure, threatening the biodiversity of the forest and its health and extent. This remote sensing analysis will look at how the density and health of the forest have been evolving for the past decade using satellite images from Landsat and PlanetLabs. Using these Machine Learning classification methods and indices, the mangrove cover and health change will be quantified. A second moment of area metric will be used to represent the extent change in the forests and compared to gross cover loss. Using these methods, we have found that the mangrove forest is retreating from its' coastal front while becoming denser inland. This could point to a mechanistic response of mangrove forests to sea-level rise in this region, which patterns will be important to study further in hydrodynamic studies.}

\subsection{Study Site}
The Grand-Pierre Bay Mangrove Forest is situated at the estuary of the l’Estere, Artibonite, and La Quinte rivers. It is the largest mangrove cover in Haiti and features a sea -> mangrove -> marsh -> land system.
\subsection{Ongoing Conservation Efforts}
Discuss ongoing conservation efforts here. Might need to interview Mr. Jean Wiener again.

\section{Materials and Methods}
This analysis makes use of an array of satellite imagery solutions, indices and image classification methods to detect and quantify mangrove cover change during the period extending from 2010 to 2022. The different datasets, data acquisition, classification and analysis methods are as follow:

\subsection{Datasets}
\subsubsection{Landsat}
Landsat refers to series of satellite observation missions by NASA and the USGS. They specialize in Earth observations and feature bands in RGB, Near Infrared, Short-Wave Infrared and Thermal Infrared. Landsat 7 and 8 were used to track NDVI changes between the past decade in the region (2010 – 2022). While the resolution of Landsat 7-8 instruments (30-meters) are lower than other commercially available satellites, it is very convenient for getting numerous readings for long periods of time for a large region. As such, it was mainly used to form time-series of NDVI in the whole forest and certain key regions.

\subsubsection{PlanetLabs}
PlanetLabs data present much higher resolution (3-5m) but fewer bands for analysis (only Red, Blue, Green and Near-Infrared). It is also costly to pull near-weekly data from PlanetLabs. As such, observations around the first 2 months of the year, every 3 years, are taken between 2010 and 2022. This data has been used to monitor mangrove cover and coastline change.

\subsection{Workflow}
** Add figure showing workflow **

Low Tides -> Image Acquisition -> NDWI masking -> Kmeans Clustering -> Gross Cover Change -> Polar Moment of Area Metric -> NDVI Timeseries -> dNDVI Analysis

\subsection{Low-Tide Data Acquisition}
The partially submerged nature of mangrove forests can lead to inconsistencies when trying to track their cover using remote sensing, as submerged regions during flood tides can get hidden away from the satellite view depending on the time of observation. As such, it was decided to only get PlanetLabs observations at the lowest tides of the year to observe the maximum cover of the mangrove forests.
To get the tidal schedule at our site, we established a 1:1 relationship between it and the tidal schedule at Port-au-Prince, Haiti, located in the same basin of the La Gonave Gulf. This is accomplished via hydrodynamic modeling in Delft3D-Flow, where measurements of the tidal regime in Port-au-Prince are related to the boundary conditions of the basin by regression. ** Make workflow plot explaining this process better **. 
With the tidal regime at our site in hand, we can then select available satellite imagery at the lowest available tidal ranges every year. 

\subsection{Image Classification}
\subsubsection{K-means Clustering}
We use K-means Clustering, a vector quantization method, on the surface reflectance values to classify the different land cover into 4 types: open water, mangrove vegetation, viable land, and bare soil (mud flat). The viable land classification refers to pixels containing either low-density vegetation, or bare soil that is fit for colonization by mangroves. After masking out the open water and bare soil covers, the remaining mangrove vegetation and viable land covers are compared over years to track the patterns in mangrove cover change.

\subsubsection{Deep Learning Classification}
??? (Potential Future Work.)
\subsubsection{Gross Cover Loss and Second Moment of Area}
Using the final mangrove cover extents, we calculate two metrics to quantify and characterize the cover change patterns in subregions: gross cover loss and polar moment of area.
With Gross Cover Loss (GCL), we simply take the difference in covered pixels between 2022 and 2010, multiplying that number of pixels by the unit pixel area to obtain an area in km sq. 

The polar moment of area (MOA) on the other looks at the distribution of those pixels related to the center of the extent of a subregion. The second moment of area (2MOA) of the mangrove cover is calculated in relation to the center x and y axes as a sum of the 2MOAs of all pixels:

\[I_x = \sum{A\times d_x^2} \] 
\[I_y = \sum{A\times d_y^2} \]

The overall MOA metric is then the sum of $I_{x}$ and $I_{y}$:
\[MOA (J_z) = I_x + I_z \]

\subsection{Indices}
\subsubsection{NDWI Masking Pre-Processing}
To simplify the clustering process of, we mask out the open water regions surrounding the mangrove forest. This is done using the green and NIR bands of PlanetLabs, following the relation defined by McFeeters (1996):
\[NDWI = \frac {Xgreen - Xnir}{Xgreen + Xnir} \]
The resulting masked out images are then used in our classifications and analyses.

\subsubsection{NDVI Analysis}
The land surfaces that we find after masking out open water using NDWI are analyzed by NDVI to gauge the change in health of the forest. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is a simple indicator of the presence, density and health of green vegetation. This index uses the green and near-infrared bands of observations as follow:
\[NDVI = \frac{Xnir - Xred}{Xnir + Xred}\]
To gauge the change in health, we look at the spatial difference of the NDVI distribution between 2022 and 2010:
\[dNDVI = NDVI_{2022} - NDVI_{2010}\]
Additionally, the average NDVI of Landsat observations over that time period are used for time-series showing trends of NDVI change in more detail.

This is the example 1 of equation:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

This is the example 2 of equation:
\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}
